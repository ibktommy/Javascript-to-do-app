# Javascript-to-do-app
A To-Do-App created using Vanilla Javascript

This web project is a basic Task List App I developed using HTML/CSS/JS.<br>
The Javascript code enables the the app to have several functions. <br>
You can input a task, add the task, delete a particular task or delete all tasks at once. <br>
The app task data is also stored in the local storage of the browser such that the task app data is not
cleared when the browser is refreshed. <br>
I have made the delete funtion such that when one deletes a particular task or deletes all task, then such tasks is deleted from the 
local storage. <br>
